## Micro-iteration Process Reflection
- I found the micro-iteration process to be very helpful and prefer this way of integrating AI into my workflow.
Because each step was fairly small, I wasn’t overwhelmed with hundreds of lines of code from Claude at once and could more easily review the output.
I used the self-review process at each step to ensure the new code integrated into my existing code without issue and to check for any bugs.
Through this process, I caught a few minor bugs that didn’t present any major issues but could have posed problems later on.

However, I found that I prefer working with Claude in the CLI as opposed to on the web, as I could more easily work side-by-side with Claude and could see the changes to my codebase in real time.
I felt like I had less insight into the process since I couldn’t see the live changes. In the future, I would like to use the micro-iteration process with Claude in VS code.
